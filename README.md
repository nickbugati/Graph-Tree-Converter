# Graph-Tree-Converter
Converts Weighted Graphs into two types of Binary Trees. One is organized based off of node values, and the other is organized based off of shortest path distances from a node of choice on the graph

Nodes contain sorted vectors that share values in order to reduce the size of the balanced trees, as well as prevent duplicate values. They are sorted on the either distance from a given node or on price (The secondary value not relevant in sorting the tree).
